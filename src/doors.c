/* Ideas:

Doors will be like wall blocks, but when a certain button is pressed, the wall
will lower down and disappear.

If that's hard, then it will just disappear.

They will be applied the same rules as walls and they'll appear in the map as
'D'.

Doors will have collision until they are 100% open.
